## Versioning

Major releases are made every 6 months on a set schedule. We target January as a major release (e.g. `10.0.0`), then
July as the stable dot release (e.g. `10.2.0`). Unstable releases (i.e. _development_ versions) have odd minor versions
(e.g. `10.1.*`, `10.3.*`).

To upgrade from one stable release to the next, you must first install and run the migrations for the latest stable
release you are on, then every stable release afterwards. For example if you're upgrading from `7.4` to `8.0`, you
need to upgrade to `7.4.2` before upgrading to `8.0`.
